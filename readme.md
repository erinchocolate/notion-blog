# Meiqiao's Second Brain

## About

This blog is powered by Notion and Next.js. I watched the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04exSpZ9IZ8&pp=ygUQbm90aW9uIG5leHQgYmxvZw%3D%3D) on how to set up a blog using Notion as CMS and then cloned the [Next.js Notion Starter Kit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit) repo.

## Why I started blogging

Starting a blog has been on my mind for a while. However, not knowing what to write and needing more motivation held me back. But recently, after completing my master's degree and reflecting a bit, I finally pulled the trigger. I'm sharing three reasons that pushed me to get typing:

### 💬Learning by Sharing

Someone once told me, "If you want to understand something, teach it." This wisdom truly hit home during the final group project of my master's program.

At the beginning of our project, our team struggled with using Git. Every time we tried to merge code from different branches, it was chaos. So, after our first sprint, I suggested having a Git workshop to help everyone on the same page on how to use Git for this project. I watched a bunch of Git tutorials that night, and the next day, I guided my team through a 15-minute crash course on Git workflows and commands. After that workshop, we became more confident with Git, and merging code was not scary anymore. I noticed during the process that my understanding of Git had deepened a lot.

This experience resonates with the "Feynman Technique" I came across in a video. Feynman's Technique is about using teaching to solidify learning. When we watch videos or read books, we passively absorb information, but when we explain what we learn to others, we actively recall and retrieve information from our brains. I want to use this blog to apply the Feynman Technique: I learn something new and then reinforce that knowledge by sharing it here.

### 🚀Reflection as a Growth Accelerator

Another valuable takeaway from my master's was the power of reflection. We need to submit two reflection reports on our internship for our last paper. The report needs to answer these questions:

- What I did
- What was the result
- What went well and why
- What I can improve in the future

Initially, it felt like homework. But over time, I realized that these reflections weren't just mere assignments. They helped me internalize the lessons I learned from my experience.

For instance, my team got stuck setting up the environment at the beginning of my internship. After hours of exploring, we still didn't figure it out, so we asked a senior developer for help. Observing him tackling the problem made me realize that it's important to document each of our attempts, and we need to seek help promptly when stuck. Such reflections impacted my problem-solving approach during the internship.

While experiences can offer lessons, if I don't write down these lessons, they are just fleeting thoughts. Only when I write them down do I start to internalize them, and then they can shape how I act and react in the future. So this is what I want to do here: share my reflections to learn from them twice over – once when I experience them and again when I write about them.

### 💡Getting Better at Communicating

I've been writing diaries and journals for the past nine years. This habit significantly sharpened my verbal communication. When a conversation touches upon a topic I've previously written about, my responses are quicker and more articulate.

I learned from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-Zel07vrro&t=121s&pp=ygUTZHIgayB3aHkgd2UgY2FuIHNheQ==) that the part of the brain we use for thinking differs from communicating. When we communicate verbally or in writing, we use the linguistic cortex that helps us express the ideas in the language.

Therefore, to be better at communication, we need to deliberately practice our linguistic cortex by talking with people or writing down thoughts. Though I've written extensively in personal journals, the nature of those writings is casual – more like thought pieces. I want to try something different with my blog and invest more in crafting structured, in-depth content. By doing this, I can develop more profound opinions on specific topics.

With these three goals in mind, I've decided what I want to share on my blog:

- **Handbooks** - notes on stuff I'm learning, like SQL, Java etc
- **Reflections** - Real talk about lessons from my experience.
- **Projects** - A behind-the-scenes look at the things I've been making.
